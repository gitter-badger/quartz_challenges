# Redis is a key-value store (or more generally a data structure server)

# Install redis locally and write code that shows how you would implement a simple worker/queue system using redis.

# You should create 2 "workers" in the language of your choice- each should be a standalone script that interact with a locally running instance of the redis server

#   worker1
#     generates a random number once every second and adds it to a queue for worker2 to process

#   worker2
#     keeps a redis key called 'total' updated with the running sum of all numbers that appear in its queue
